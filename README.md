# Insights INC â€“ Project Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

I built a Power BI dashboard to analyze project performance, focusing on delays, WIP aging, and vertical head performance.

## Project Workflow

**Data Import**  
- Loaded project data from Excel into Power BI Desktop  

**Data Cleaning**  
- Removed duplicates  
- Handled missing values  
- Standardized date formats & project status labels  

**Data Transformation**  
- Created calculated columns for variance  
- Created WIP project aging buckets  

**Dashboard Creation & Validation**  
- Designed a multi-page dashboard (Overview, Performance Analysis, Vertical Head Performance)  
- Verified KPIs: Delayed Projects, WIP Aging, Positive Projects
