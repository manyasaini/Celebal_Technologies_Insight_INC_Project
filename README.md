# Insight INC with Power BI
## Project Overview
In this project, I built a Power BI dashboard to analyze the internal project performance of a software services company.  
The goal was to help leadership identify delays, monitor ongoing projects, and evaluate vertical head performance efficiently. 
## Key steps
1. **Data Import :**  Loaded project data from Excel into Power BI Desktop  
2. **Data Cleaning :**
  - Removed duplicates  
  - Handled missing values  
  - Standardized date formats & project status labels
3. **Data Transformation :**
  - Created calculated columns for variance and WIP project aging buckets
4. **Dashboard Creation & Validation :**  
  - Designed a multi-page dashboard (Overview, Performance Analysis, Vertical Head Performance)  
  - Verified KPIs - Delayed Projects, WIP Aging, Positive Projects
